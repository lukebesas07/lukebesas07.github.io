        <h3>What is High Stakes?</h3>
        <p>
          The VEX V5 Robotics Competition: High Stakes is played between two alliances, red and blue, each consisting of two teams, on a 12’ x 12’ field featuring a central ladder, stakes, mobile goals, and rings. The objective is to score more points than the opposing alliance by placing rings on stakes, positioning mobile goals, and climbing the ladder. Each ring scored on a stake is worth one point, while the top ring on a stake is worth three points. The mobile goals are hexagonal objects with a maximum diameter of 10 inches and an overall height of 14.5 inches. At the center of the field, the ladder has three levels and includes one high stake for additional challenge. Matches are divided into a 15-second autonomous period followed by a 1 minute and 45-second driver-controlled period. According to the rules, rings may only be counted once for scoring, and during the final 15 seconds of the match, teams are prohibited from touching scored rings or mobile goals in the positive corners.

          In this match, We were alliances with a strong team (Arrowhead Robotics), The 15-sec autonomous gave as an early lead and we were feeling confident about the match. Standing against us is the 2 best teams of the International School Manila, a school that is known to have the budget to create very advanced robots in this competition. Ever since we joined the VEX scene, The greatest roadblock is always ISM. Last year, They dominated the nationals and destroyed our chance of going to Dallas, Texas. This year, We dominated the nationals with a perfect score of 8 wins and 0 losses. It was looking bright for us and if we wanted to go to Texas, Finals 1 will decide our fate.

          After taking the first game, We only needed one more win to become Tournament Champions and Fly to Worlds. You might be watching and asked yourself "What the hell just happened?" let me break it down for you. The robots nearest us are our alliance robots, its the ones with a red plate. Now contrary to our qualifying matches, we had to play a more defensive role in this game inorder to win. The plan is to secure a double-point corner and defend it so that the other team cant get to it while my teammate scores rings. Once he is finished scoring, He would go to the corner I was defending and score it in the double points corner. after that, I can score as much as I wanted to without going back to the corner (Which our team known for). But around 2:13 mins, The goal was just stuck to back of our robot making us unable to score. The first to come to mind as a driver was "Oh sh*t were screwed, they are depending on me to score" I was panicking and trying to think a way to make this goal stuck behind the robot to be useful. So what did i do? I calmed down and looked around the field and scan for other objectives that can help us win. Then there it is, An open double-point corner where i can remove the enemy goal and practically secure the win. I rushed after it and somehow i got through 2 robots defending it LOL. As i spun around to put the stuck goal in the corner, We already knew it. We won. We are going to Texas. We were the tournament Champions.
